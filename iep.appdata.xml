    IEP (pronounced as eep) is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on
    interactivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable for
    scientific computing. Its practical design is aimed at simplicity
    and efficiency.
    </p><p>
    It consists of two main components, the editor and the shell, and uses
    a set of pluggable tools to help the programmer in various ways. Some
    example tools are source structure, project manager, interactive help,
    workspace ... 
    </p><p>
    IEP is written in (pure) Python 3 and uses the Qt GUI toolkit. Binaries
    are provided for all major operating system. After installing IEP, it
    can be used to execute code on any Python version available on your
    system (Python 2.4 - 3.x, including Pypy).
